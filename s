## Experience

### Independent Full‑Stack & Web3 Engineer · Remote
*Self‑directed projects and collaborations*

- Designed and implemented decentralized governance, DeFi, and AI‑powered applications using Solidity, Rust, Next.js, Node.js, and Python.  
- Built and tested smart contracts powering 1,000+ testnet transactions, securing $2M+ in virtual assets and governance for 500+ simulated users.  
- Developed responsive frontends with Next.js, React, TypeScript, and Tailwind, integrating wallets and on‑chain data (Ethers.js/Web3.js).  
- Modeled and managed application data using relational and NoSQL databases (PostgreSQL, MongoDB).  
- Applied security and reliability best practices: access control, re‑entrancy protection, static analysis (Slither), and automated test suites (Hardhat).  
- Used Docker, GitHub Actions, and cloud services to create reproducible development and deployment pipelines.

## Selected Projects

### Nexus DAO – Decentralized Governance Platform
**Tech:** Solidity, OpenZeppelin, Hardhat, Ethers.js, Next.js, React, TypeScript, Tailwind, PostgreSQL/MongoDB  

- Built a DAO governance system on Ethereum with proposals, voting, and treasury management smart contracts.  
- Implemented a Next.js/React frontend with wallet integration, proposal creation, voting flows, and real‑time state updates from the blockchain.  
- Executed 1,000+ testnet transactions and simulated 500+ governance users to validate business logic and edge cases.  
- Added automated tests and static analysis (Hardhat, Slither) to prevent common smart‑contract vulnerabilities.

### Veiled Yield – DeFi Yield Farming Protocol
**Tech:** Solidity, OpenZeppelin, Chainlink, Ethers.js, Next.js, React, TypeScript, Tailwind, PostgreSQL/MongoDB  

- Developed yield‑farming smart contracts for staking, reward distribution, and fee logic with a focus on gas efficiency and clarity.  
- Created a modern Next.js frontend with dashboards for portfolio tracking, APY visualization, and transaction history.  
- Integrated on‑chain price feeds and protocol data (e.g., via Chainlink and Ethers.js) to calculate and present real‑time metrics.  
- Simulated $2M+ in virtual assets under management to stress‑test reward logic and protocol behavior.

---

### FitCipher – AI‑Powered Web3 Fitness DApp
**Tech:** Solana, Rust, Python, TensorFlow/PyTorch, Next.js, React, TypeScript, Tailwind, REST/GraphQL APIs  

- Built a Solana‑based DApp that rewards users with tokens based on fitness activity scored by AI models.  
- Implemented Rust on‑chain programs for rewards and state management, connected to off‑chain services via secure APIs.  
- Used Python with TensorFlow/PyTorch for activity analysis and anomaly detection; exposed scores to the DApp through backend services.  
- Designed and implemented a responsive Next.js frontend with dashboards for user progress, rewards, and engagement analytics.
